# codepen clone

I use some npm package such as codemirror, react-codemirror2, react-typed etc.
If you want to clone codepen clone with those packages please write like that.

# codemirror install
npm : 
### npm i codemirror 
yarn : 
### yarn add codemirror

# react-codemirror2 install
npm : 
### npm i react-codemirror2
yarn :
### yarn add react-codemirror2

# react-typed
npm :
### npm i react-typed
yarn :
### yarn add react-typed

If you have a question about codepen-clone, please leave me a message.
